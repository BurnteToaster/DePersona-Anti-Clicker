# DePersona (Anti-Clicker)
DePersona is an Android Studio Game made in Java and XML. DePersona is an Anti-Clicker, a game that reciprocates off of ideas from Clicker/Incremental games.

Menu:
- PLAY enters the game
- SETTINGS allows you to mute music or sfx
- QUIT closes the app

Game Screen:
While in the game (after hitting PLAY), the player will see:
- <- to go back to menu
- "INC: #" to show how much your score is increasing
- "DEC: #" to show how much your score is decreasing
- a large number showing the player's score
- an Upgrades menu:
  + Gray Tab to move menu up and down
  + Upgrade names
  + Upgrade powers to show how they affect the score
  + Upgrade prices to show how much they cost
  + Upgrade counts to show how many the player has
  + BUY buttons to buy 1 upgrade
  
How to play:
While in the game (after hitting PLAY), the player has the ability to:
- tap on the screen to DECREASE their score
- buy upgrades to allow their score to increase OUT of the game
- go back to the menu before their score decreases
  + score does not decrease in menu
  
Theme:
  In order to make progress, the player must quickly and strategically buy upgrades to ensure that their score goes as high as possible while they are 
  out of the game. DePersona is a game that represents my experiences of depersonalization, where dissociative experiences such as the recurring feeling 
  of being detached from one’s body can lead to loss of sense of self or sense of personal morality. The game itself acts as a “dissociative experience”, 
  where the player is rewarded for not playing the game. The sense of being grounded and not stuck in your mind (or not playing the game) is the factor 
  of improvement, which is shown by increasing the score.
  
Works in Progress (04/29/2023):
- Adjusting numbers and changing functions for proper game balance
  + Plan to use logarithmic functions for initial high power with a falloff later per upgrade
- Changing logo to fit current title (I had made the logo first based on the idea then ended up with a title for the game)

(06/19/2023)
- I want to move this game to Unity so this project will be on pause for a bit, and the repo will be updated accordingly soon.
